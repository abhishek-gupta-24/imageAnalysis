# 🧠 Image Analysis with Grad-CAM (Explainable AI)

This project is designed for explainable image classification using Grad-CAM and PyTorch. It includes a backend setup that processes uploaded images, generates predictions, and visualizes model attention with a heatmap overlay.

---

## 🚀 Features

- PyTorch-based image classification
- Grad-CAM heatmap generation for model explainability
- REST API backend (Flask or FastAPI depending on your setup)
- React frontend (optional: connect to visualize results)
